        <h1>A space built by young people who care deeply about mental health.</h1>
        <p>Solicitude is a youth led, non profit mental health initiative created to make conversations around emotions, psychology, and well being feel honest, accessible, and human. It began with a simple realisation. Many people are struggling quietly, and very few spaces allow them to talk about it without fear, labels, or pressure.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p><strong>It did not start as an organisation. It started as a concern.</strong></p>
            <p>Solicitude was founded by <strong>Aisha Mohammad Nasser</strong>, a 17 year old aspiring psychologist, who noticed how often mental health conversations were avoided, misunderstood, or reduced to stereotypes.</p>
            <p>Friends, classmates, and people online were clearly struggling, yet most of them felt they had to deal with it alone. There was awareness, but very little understanding. There was information, but not enough empathy.</p>
            <p>Solicitude was created to bridge that gap. Not as a clinical service, and not as a temporary campaign, but as a growing initiative focused on awareness, education, and emotional expression.</p>

            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <p><strong>Mental health conversations should feel safe, not intimidating.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="divider-content">
            <p>We believe that people should not have to reach a breaking point before they feel allowed to talk about how they feel.</p>
            <p>We believe that understanding psychology helps reduce fear, shame, and stigma.</p>
            <p>We believe that lived experiences matter just as much as theory.</p>
            <p>We believe that young voices deserve space and respect in mental health discussions.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, we believe that listening is just as important as speaking.</p>

        <div class="side-content">
            <h2>What Makes Solicitude Different</h2>
            <p>Solicitude does not position itself as a solution to every mental health problem. Instead, we focus on doing a few things responsibly and with care.</p>
            <p>We combine research, surveys, and educational content with real stories and creative expression.</p>
            <p>We communicate clearly about our limits and never claim to replace professional mental health care.</p>
            <p>We prioritise sensitivity, consent, and dignity in everything we share.</p>
            <p><strong>Our work is guided by intent, not trends.</strong></p>

        <p>We create content and initiatives that are informative, relatable, and respectful.</p>
        <p>We share stories only with permission and care for the people behind them.</p>
        <p>We collaborate with individuals and organisations who align with our values.</p>
        <p>Every step is taken with the understanding that mental health is personal and sensitive.</p>

            <p>Solicitude focuses on mental health awareness, education, and community engagement.</p>
            <p>We do not provide therapy, counselling, diagnosis, or medical treatment.</p>
            <p>We do not position ourselves as experts above others. We are learners, listeners, and facilitators of conversation.</p>

    <!--Why This-->

    <section class="basic-layout">
        <h2>Why This Work Matters</h2>
        <p><strong>Because silence can be heavy.</strong></p>
        <p>When mental health is ignored, people carry emotions they do not understand or know how to express.</p>
        <p>Awareness creates language. Language creates understanding. Understanding reduces stigma.</p>
        <p><strong>That is the change Solicitude is working towards, one conversation at a time.</strong></p>

    <!--Looking Ahead-->
    
    <section class="basic-layout">
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p><strong>This is only the beginning.</strong></p>
        <p>Solicitude aims to continue growing through research, campaigns, collaborations, and community led initiatives.</p>
        <p>As the initiative grows, the focus will remain the same. Staying honest, responsible, and human.</p>
