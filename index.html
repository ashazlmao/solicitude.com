            <p>Solicitude is a <span class="highlights">youth led, non profit mental health initiative</span> based in India. <strong>We work to spread awareness, encourage honest emotional expression, and break the stigma around mental well being</strong> through education, stories, and community driven efforts.</p>
            <p><span class="highlights">We do not offer therapy or quick solutions.</span> <strong>What we offer is understanding, awareness, and a safe starting point for people who feel unheard, confused, or simply curious</strong> about mental health.</p>

            <h2>Why Solicitude Exists</h2>
            <p><strong>Because silence should not be the default.</strong></p>
            <h3>What we see around us</h3>
            <p>Across India, many people struggle quietly with emotions they do not fully understand or feel safe talking about. <span class="highlights">Mental health is often brushed aside, joked about, or discussed only when things become unbearable.</span>
            <br>
            <strong>Young people face constant pressure from academics, family expectations, social comparison, and uncertainty about the future.</strong> <span class="highlights">Yet there are very few spaces where they can speak honestly without fear of being judged or misunderstood.</span></p>
            <h3>Why this gap still exists</h3>
            <p>Most mental health conversations are <strong>either too clinical to relate to or too shallow to actually help.</strong> When people cannot see themselves in the conversation, <span class="highlights">they stop engaging altogether.</span>
            <br><br>
            <strong>Solicitude exists to <span class="highlights">make mental health conversations feel human, relatable, and accessible</span> before silence turns into suffering.</strong></p>
